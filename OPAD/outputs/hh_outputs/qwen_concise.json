Bias and discrimination: AI systems can perpetuate and even exacerbate existing biases and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or designed with biased assumptions. For example, facial recognition technology has been shown to be less accurate for people of color and women, which can lead to false arrests and other harmful outcomes.\r\n\r\n2. Privacy",
